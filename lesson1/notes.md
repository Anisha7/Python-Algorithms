# Lesson 1
## Getting Started
### What differentiates programming from computer science?
	
Programming involves constructing a program or application using code, whereas computer science is broader as it is the study of programming. Computer Science is more of work that goes before programming, such as the thought process, designing, and such. 

### What are two examples that could result in math.factorial generating errors?

One example that could result in math.factorial generating errors demonstrates the importance of calling math.factorial after importing the math module, because the program needs to be told that you are using the math module. 
Another example involves the use of non-integer values such as 5.2. This results in math.factorial generating errors because it cannot evaluate non-integer values. 

### What is Dead Code
Dead code is defined as code that will never be executed.

### What would result in Python printing this error message:  "TypeError: unsupported operand type9s) for *: 'NoneType' and 'int'"?

The statement not having a return statement.

### What is the definition of "helper functions"?

Helper functions are functions written to help other functions with code reuse and more.

### What is one reason for not using global variables?

If two functions use the same global, they will conflict with each other and even accidentally modify variables for the other function.

## Data and Expressions Video

### What does pow(x,y) evaluate to?

It evaluates to x to the y power (x^y or x**y).

### What is the difference between x/y and x//y?

x/y is x divided by y normally, but x//y is doing integer division by going to the next highest integer.

### What does one mean by "Types affect semantics"?

Types(such as integers)affect semantics(such as the meaning of the symbol such as an asteric. The integers or strings and such types affect the result and semantics.

### What is the difference between x//y and x%y?

x//y is doing integer division of x by y but x%y is giving the remainder when x is divided by y.

### Why is it that printing ((0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1) == 0.3) prints False and not True?

Double equals cannot be used for floating point numbers. It looks for the exact number and we need to look for a nearly/almost equals option, because there is a tiny difference between the result of the expression and 0.3 .

That's it for lesson 1.  We hope you had fun, learned a thing or two, and are now ready to dive in when we get going in earnest on lesson 2!

Carpe diem!
