# Python-Algorithms

### In this repository, I study Python and explore numerous python methods and algorithms

### Each lesson will include notes to go over concepts for that lesson, code for algorithms relating to the lesson plan, and some lab work that focuses on building those concepts.

### You will need tkinter to run some of the python apps
